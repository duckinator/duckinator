### Hello!

I'm Ellen. You probably know me better as _duckinator_ or _puppy_.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Bork](https://github.com/duckinator/bork) and [Boreutils](https://github.com/duckinator/boreutils).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about expert systems &mdash; look forward to a new project related to this Soon™!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help refactoring [Bork](https://github.com/duckinator/bork).

You can support me on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/duckinator), to keep my open source work going!

(And also to offset the fact that my pay dropped 60% as a direct result of COVID-19. 😢)
