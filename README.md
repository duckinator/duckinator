### Hello!

I'm Ellen. You probably know me better as _duckinator_ or _puppy_.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Bork](https://github.com/duckinator/bork) and [Boreutils](https://github.com/duckinator/boreutils).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) &mdash; look forward to a new project related to this Soonâ„¢!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help refactoring Bork.

**If you can, please consider supporting me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/duckinator).**

My income has dropped by 60% due to COVID-19, and getting support for more of my open source work would help a lot. :heart:
