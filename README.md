### Hello!

I'm Ellen. You probably know me better as _duckinator_ or _puppy_.

**I'm currently in the process of moving so I may take a while to respond to issues and pull requests.**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Bork](https://github.com/duckinator/bork) and [Boreutils](https://github.com/duckinator/boreutils).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about [expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system).
<!-- - ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help refactoring Bork. -->
